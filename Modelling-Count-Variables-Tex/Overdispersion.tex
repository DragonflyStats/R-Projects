\frametitle{Overdispersion}
Real-life count data are frequently characterized by overdispersion and excess zeros. Zero-inflated count models
provide a parsimonious yet powerful way to model this type of situation. Such models assume that the data are a
mixture of two separate data generation processes: one generates only zeros, and the other is either a Poisson or
a negative binomial data-generating process. The result of a Bernoulli trial is used to determine which of the two
processes generates an observation.
