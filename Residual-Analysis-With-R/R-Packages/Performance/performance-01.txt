  model_performance.lm  Performance of Regression Models
Description
Compute indices of model performance for regression models.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'lm'
model_performance(model, metrics = "all", verbose = TRUE, ...)
Arguments
modelA model.
metrics  Can be "all", "common" or a character vector of metrics to be computed (some
 of c("AIC","BIC","R2","RMSE","SIGMA","LOGLOSS","PCP","SCORE")). "common"
 will compute AIC, BIC, R2 and RMSE.
verbose  Toggle off warnings.
...  Arguments passed to or from other methods.
Details
Depending on model, following indices are computed:
   *  AIC Akaike’s Information Criterion, see ?stats::AIC
   *  BIC Bayesian Information Criterion, see ?stats::BIC
   *  R2 r-squared value, see r2
   *  R2_adj adjusted r-squared, see r2
38   model_performance.merMod
*  RMSE root mean squared error, see performance_rmse
*  SIGMA residual standard deviation, see get_sigma()
*  LOGLOSS Log-loss, see performance_logloss
*  SCORE_LOG score of logarithmic proper scoring rule, see performance_score
*  SCORE_SPHERICAL score of spherical proper scoring rule, see performance_score
*  PCP percentage of correct predictions, see performance_pcp
Value
 A data frame (with one row) and one column per "index" (see metrics).

#### Examples
 model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
 model_performance(model)
 model <- glm(vs ~ wt + mpg, data = mtcars, family = "binomial")
 model_performance(model)
   model_performance.merMod
 Performance of Mixed Models
Description
 Compute indices of model performance for mixed models.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

 ## S3 method for class 'merMod'
 model_performance(model, metrics = "all", verbose = TRUE, ...)
Arguments
 modelA mixed effects model.
 metrics  Can be "all", "common" or a character vector of metrics to be computed (some
  of c("AIC","BIC","R2","ICC","RMSE","SIGMA","LOGLOSS","SCORE")). "common"
  will compute AIC, BIC, R2, ICC and RMSE.
 verbose  Toggle off warnings.
 ...  Arguments passed to or from other methods.
Details
 This method returns the adjusted ICC only, as this is typically of interest when judging the variance
 attributed to the random effects part of the model (see also icc).
 Furthermore, see ’Details’ in model_performance.lm for more details on returned indices.
model_performance.rma  39
Value
A data frame (with one row) and one column per "index" (see metrics).

#### Examples
if (require("lme4")) {
  model <- lmer(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length + (1 | Species), data = iris)
  model_performance(model)
}
  model_performance.rma Performance of Meta-Analysis Models
Description
Compute indices of model performance for meta-analysis model from the metafor package.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'rma'
model_performance(model, metrics = "all", verbose = TRUE, ...)
Arguments
model   A rma object as returned by metafor::rma().
metrics Can be "all" or a character vector of metrics to be computed (some of c("AIC","BIC","I2","H2","TAU
verbose Toggle off warnings.
... Arguments passed to or from other methods.
Details
  Indices of fit:
   *  AIC Akaike’s Information Criterion, see ?stats::AIC
   *  BIC Bayesian Information Criterion, see ?stats::BIC
   *  I2: For a random effects model, I2 estimates (in percent) how much of the total variability
  in the effect size estimates can be attributed to heterogeneity among the true effects. For a
  mixed-effects model, I2 estimates how much of the unaccounted variability can be attributed
  to residual heterogeneity.
   *  H2: For a random-effects model, H2 estimates the ratio of the total amount of variability in
  the effect size estimates to the amount of sampling variability. For a mixed-effects model, H2
  estimates the ratio of the unaccounted variability in the effect size estimates to the amount of
  sampling variability.
   *  TAU2: The amount of (residual) heterogeneity in the random or mixed effects model.
   *  CochransQ (QE): Test for (residual) Heterogeneity. Without moderators in the model, this
  is simply Cochran’s Q-test.
40   model_performance.stanreg
*  Omnibus (QM): Omnibus test of parameters.
*  R2: Pseudo-R2-statistic, which indicates the amount of heterogeneity accounted for by the
moderators included in a fixed-effects model.
   See the documentation for ?metafor::fitstats.
Value
 A data frame (with one row) and one column per "index" (see metrics).

#### Examples
 if (require("metafor")) {
   data(dat.bcg)
   dat <- escalc(measure = "RR", ai = tpos, bi = tneg, ci = cpos, di = cneg, data = dat.bcg)
   model <- rma(yi, vi, data = dat, method = "REML")
   model_performance(model)
 }
