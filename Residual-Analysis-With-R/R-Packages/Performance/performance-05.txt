   item_reliability  Reliability Test for Items or Scales
Description
 Compute various measures of internal consistencies for tests or item-scales of questionnaires.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

 item_reliability(x, standardize = FALSE, digits = 3)
Arguments
 xA matrix or a data frame.
 standardize  Logical, if TRUE, the data frame’s vectors will be standardized. Recommended
  when the variables have different measures / scales.
 digits   Amount of digits for returned values.
32  item_split_half
Details
 This function calculates the item discriminations (corrected item-total correlations for each item of
 x with the remaining items) and the Cronbach’s alpha for each item, if it was deleted from the scale.
 The absolute value of the item discrimination indices should be above 0.1. An index between 0.1
 and 0.3 is considered as "fair", while an index above 0.3 (or below -0.3) is "good". Items with low
 discrimination indices are often ambiguously worded and should be examined. Items with negative
 indices should be examined to determine why a negative value was obtained (e.g. reversed answer
 categories regarding positive and negative poles).
Value
 A data frame with the corrected item-total correlations (item discrimination, column item_discrimination)
 and Cronbach’s Alpha (if item deleted, column alpha_if_deleted) for each item of the scale, or
 NULL if data frame had too less columns.

#### Examples
 data(mtcars)
 x <- mtcars[, c("cyl", "gear", "carb", "hp")]
 item_reliability(x)
 
 
 
   item_split_half   Split-Half Reliability
Description
 Compute various measures of internal consistencies for tests or item-scales of questionnaires.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

 item_split_half(x, digits = 3)
Arguments
* x A matrix or a data frame.
* digitsAmount of digits for returned values.

####  Details
 This function calculates the split-half reliability for items in x, including the Spearman-Brown ad-
 justment. Splitting is done by selecting odd versus even columns in x. A value closer to 1 indicates
 greater internal consistency.

#### Value
 A list with two elements: the split-half reliability splithalf and the Spearman-Brown corrected
 split-half reliability spearmanbrown.



#### Examples
```{r}
	 data(mtcars)
 x <- mtcars[, c("cyl", "gear", "carb", "hp")]
 item_split_half(x)
```
