   looicLOO-related Indices for Bayesian regressions.

#### Description

 pected log predictive density) for Bayesian regressions.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

 looic(model, verbose = TRUE)
Arguments
 model   A Bayesian regression model.
 verbose Toggle off warnings.
Value
 A list with four elements, the ELPD, LOOIC and their standard errors.

#### Examples
 if (require("rstanarm")) {
   model <- stan_glm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars, chains = 1, iter = 500, refresh = 0)
   looic(model)
 }

#### Description
 See the documentation for your object’s class:
   *  Frequentist Regressions
   *  Instrumental Variables Regressions
   *  Mixed models
   *  Bayesian models
   *  CFA / SEM lavaan models
   *  Meta-analysis models

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

 model_performance(model, ...)
 performance(model, ...)

#### Arguments
 model  Statistical model.
 ...Arguments passed to or from other methods, resp. for compare_performance(),
one or multiple model objects (also of different classes).

#### Value
 A data frame (with one row) and one column per "index" (see metrics).
See Also
 compare_performance() to compare performance of many different models.

#### Examples
```{r}

#### Usage 
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'ivreg'
model_performance(model, metrics = "all", verbose = TRUE, ...)
Arguments
model A model.

Details
  Indices of fit:
*  Chisq: The model Chi-squared assesses overall fit and the discrepancy between the sample
   and fitted covariance matrices. Its p-value should be > .05 (i.e., the hypothesis of a perfect fit
   cannot be rejected). However, it is quite sensitive to sample size.
*  GFI/AGFI: The (Adjusted) Goodness of Fit is the proportion of variance accounted for by
   the estimated population covariance. Analogous to R2. The GFI and the AGFI should be >
   .95 and > .90, respectively.
*  NFI/NNFI/TLI: The (Non) Normed Fit Index. An NFI of 0.95, indicates the model of
   interest improves the fit by 95% relative to the null model. The NNFI (also called the Tucker
   Lewis index; TLI) is preferable for smaller samples. They should be > .90 (Byrne, 1994) or
   > .95 (Schumacker & Lomax, 2004).
*  CFI: The Comparative Fit Index is a revised form of NFI. Not very sensitive to sample
   size (Fan, Thompson, & Wang, 1999). Compares the fit of a target model to the fit of an
   independent, or null, model. It should be > .90.
*  RMSEA: The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation is a parsimony-adjusted index.
   Values closer to 0 represent a good fit. It should be < .08 or < .05. The p-value printed with
   it tests the hypothesis that RMSEA is less than or equal to .05 (a cutoff sometimes used for
   good fit), and thus should be not significant.
*  RMR/SRMR: the (Standardized) Root Mean Square Residual represents the square-root of
   the difference between the residuals of the sample covariance matrix and the hypothesized
   model. As the RMR can be sometimes hard to interpret, better to use SRMR. Should be <
   .08.
*  RFI: the Relative Fit Index, also known as RHO1, is not guaranteed to vary from 0 to 1.
   However, RFI close to 1 indicates a good fit.
*  IFI: the Incremental Fit Index (IFI) adjusts the Normed Fit Index (NFI) for sample size and
   degrees of freedom (Bollen’s, 1989). Over 0.90 is a good fit, but the index can exceed 1.
*  PNFI: the Parsimony-Adjusted Measures Index. There is no commonly agreed-upon cutoff
   value for an acceptable model for this index. Should be > 0.50.
  See the documentation for ?lavaan::fitmeasures.
  What to report: Kline (2015) suggests that at a minimum the following indices should be
  reported: The model chi-square, the RMSEA, the CFI and the SRMR.
Value
A data frame (with one row) and one column per "index" (see metrics).
