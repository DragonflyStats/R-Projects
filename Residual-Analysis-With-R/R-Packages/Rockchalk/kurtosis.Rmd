kurtosis Calculate excess kurtosis

#### Description

Kurtosis is a summary of a distribution’s shape, using the Normal distribution as a comparison. A
distribution with high kurtosis is said to be leptokurtic. It has wider, "fatter" tails and a "sharper",
more "peaked" center than a Normal distribution. In a standard Normal distribution, the kurtosis
is 3. The term "excess kurtosis" refers to the difference kurtosis 􀀀 3. Many researchers use the
term kurtosis to refer to "excess kurtosis" and this function follows suit. The user may set excess =
FALSE, in which case the uncentered kurtosis is returned.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
kurtosis(x, na.rm = TRUE, excess = TRUE, unbiased = TRUE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* x A numeric variable (vector)
* na.rm default TRUE. If na.rm = FALSE and there are missing values, the mean and variance are undefined and this function returns NA.
* excess default TRUE. If true, function returns excess kurtosis (kurtosis -3). If false, the return is simply kurtosis as defined above.
* unbiased default TRUE. Should the denominator of the variance estimate be divided by N-1, rather than N?

#### Details
If kurtosis is smaller than 3 (or excess kurtosis is negative), the tails are "thinner" than the normal
distribution (there is lower chance of extreme deviations around the mean). If kurtosis is greater
than 3 (excess kurtosis positive), then the tails are fatter (observations can be spread more widely
than in the Normal distribution).
The kurtosis may be calculated with the small-sample bias-corrected estimate of the variance. Set
unbiased = FALSE if this is not desired. It appears somewhat controversial whether this is necessary.
According to the US NIST, http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/
eda35b.htm, kurtosis is defined as

$$kurtosis = (mean((x 􀀀 mean(x))4))=var(x)2$$
where var(x) is calculated with the denominator N, rather than N 􀀀 1.
A distribution is said to be leptokurtic if it is tightly bunched in the center (spiked) and there are
long tails. The long tails reflect the probability of extreme values.
Value
A scalar value or NA
