```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rockchalk)
```


Prints out the contents of an object created by summarizeFactors in the style of ``base::summary``.

#### Description

An object with class "summarizedFactors" is the input. Such an object should be created with the function rockchalk::summarizeFactors. Each element in that list is then organized for printing in a tabular summary. This should look almost like R's own summary function, except for the additional information that these factor summaries include.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
formatSummarizedFactors(x, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``x``: A summarizedFactors object produced by summarizeFactors
* ``...``: optional arguments. Only value currently used is digits, which defaults to 2.


#### Examples

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(xcat1 = gl(10, 3), xcat2 = gl(5, 6))
summarizeFactors(dat, maxLevels = 8)
formatSummarizedFactors(summarizeFactors(dat))
```
Value
A table of formatted output
