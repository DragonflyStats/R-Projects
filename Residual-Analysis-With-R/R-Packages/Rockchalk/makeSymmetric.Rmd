makeSymmetric Create Symmetric Matrices, possibly covariance or correlation matrices,
or check a matrix for symmetry and serviceability.

#### Description

Check X and do the right thing. If X is a matrix, check that it is a valid for the intended purpose
(symmetric or correlation or covariance). If X a single value, use that to fill up a matrix. If it is
a vector, try to use it as a vech to fill the lower triangle. If d is supplied as an integer, use that as
desired size.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
makeSymmetric(X, d = NULL, diag = NULL, corr = FALSE, cov = FALSE)
</code></pre>

Arguments
X A single value, a vector (a vech), or a matrix
d Optional. An integer, the desired number of rows (or columns). Donâ€™t specify
this argument if X is already a matrix. Only required if X is an integer and diag
is not supplied. Otherwise, the function tries to deduce desired size of output
from X (as a vech) and diag.
diag Values for the diagonal. This is important because it alters the way X is interpreted.
If diag is not provided, then X is understood to include diagonal
elements.
corr TRUE or FALSE: Should we construct a correlation matrix
cov TRUE or FALSE: Should this be a covariance matrix?
Value
A d x d matrix

#### Examples
```{r}
makeSymmetric(X = 3, d = 4)
makeSymmetric(X = 3, d = 4, diag = c(99, 98, 97, 96))
makeSymmetric(c(1,2,3))
makeSymmetric(c(1,2,3), d = 5)
makeSymmetric(c(0.8,0.4, 0.2), cov = TRUE)
makeSymmetric(c(0.8,0.4, 0.2), cov = TRUE, diag = c(44, 55, 66))
```


makeVec makeVec for checking or creating vectors

#### Description

This is a convenience for handling function arguments. If x is a single value, it makes a vector of
length d in which all values are equal to x. If x is a vector, check that its length is d.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
makeVec(x = NULL, d = NULL)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
x A single value or a vector
d An integer, the desired size of the vector

#### Value
A vector of length d
