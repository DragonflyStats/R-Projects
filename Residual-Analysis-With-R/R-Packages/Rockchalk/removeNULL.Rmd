 Remove NULL values variables from a list

#### Description

Unlike vectors, lists can hold objects with value NULL. This gets rid of them.

#### Usage
<pre><code>


removeNULL(aList)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments

aList A list

#### Details

This version is NOT recursive
plyr::rbind.fill uses an experimental function that I choose to avoid. This is the "safe" version.
Value
Same list with NULLâs removed
108 residualCenter

#### Examples
```{r}


## Note it is non-recursive, NULL remains in e
x <- list(a = rnorm(5), b = NULL, c = rnorm(5), d = NULL,
e = list(f = rnorm(2), g = NULL))
x
removeNULL(x)
