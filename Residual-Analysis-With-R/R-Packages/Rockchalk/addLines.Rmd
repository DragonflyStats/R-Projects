```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rockchalk)
```


#### Description

addLines superimposes regression lines on a plotted plane. The examples will demonstrate the intended usage.
<pre><code>


addLines(to = NULL, from = NULL, col, lwd = 2, lty = 1)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments

* to a 3d plot object produced by plotPlane
* from output from a plotSlopes or plotCurves function (class="rockchalk")
* col color of plotted lines (default: "red")
* ``lwd``:  line width of added lines (default: 2)
* lty line type of added lines (default: 1)



#### Examples
```{r}


##library(rockchalk)
set.seed(12345)
dfadd <- genCorrelatedData2(100, means = c(0,0,0,0), sds = 1, rho = 0,
beta = c(0.03, 0.01, 0.1, 0.4, -0.1), stde = 2)
dfadd$xcat1 <- gl(2,50, labels=c("M","F"))
dfadd$xcat2 <- cut(rnorm(100), breaks=c(-Inf, 0, 0.4, 0.9, 1, Inf),
labels=c("R", "M", "D", "P", "G"))
dfadd$y2 <- 0.03 + 0.1*dfadd$x1 + 0.1*dfadd$x2 +
0.25*dfadd$x1*dfadd$x2 + 0.4*dfadd$x3 - 0.1*dfadd$x4 +
0.2 * as.numeric(dfadd$xcat1) +
contrasts(dfadd$xcat2)[as.numeric(dfadd$xcat2), ] %*% c(-0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0) +
1 * rnorm(100)
summarize(dfadd)
## linear ordinary regression
m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, data = dfadd)
summary(m1)
mcDiagnose(m1)
## These will be parallel lines
plotSlopes(m1, plotx = "x1", modx = "x2", modxVals = "std.dev.",
n = 5, main = "A plotSlopes result with \"std.dev.\" values of modx")
m1ps <- plotSlopes(m1, plotx = "x1", modx = "x2", modxVals = c(-2,0,2))
m1pp <- plotPlane(m1, plotx1 = "x1", plotx2 = "x2",
ticktype = "detailed", npp = 10)
addLines(from = m1ps, to = m1pp, lty = 1, lwd = 2)
m1pp <- plotPlane(m1, plotx1 = "x1", plotx2 = "x2", ticktype = "detailed",
npp = 10)
addLines(from = m1ps, to = m1pp, lty = 2, lwd = 5, col = "green")
## Other approach would wrap same into the linesFrom argument in plotPlane
plotPlane(m1, plotx1 = "x1", plotx2 = "x2", ticktype = "detailed",
npp = 10, linesFrom = m1ps)
## Need to think more on whether dotted lines from ps object should
## be converted to solid lines in plotPlane.
```


#### Details

From an educational stand point, the objective is to assist with the studentâ€™s conceptualization of
the two and three dimensional regression relationships.
