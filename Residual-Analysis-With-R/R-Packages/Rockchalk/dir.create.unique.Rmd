```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(rockchalk)
```

Create a uniquely named directory. Appends number & optionally date to directory name.

#### Description

Checks if the requested directory exists. If so, will create new directory name. My favorite method is to have the target directory with a date-based subdirectory, but set usedate as FALSE if you don't like that. Arguments showWarnings, recursive, and mode are passed along to R's dir.create, which does the actual work here.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
dir.create.unique(path, usedate = TRUE, showWarnings = TRUE,
recursive = TRUE, mode = "0777")
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* path A character string for the base name of the directory.
* usedate TRUE or FALSE: Insert YYYYMMDD information?
* showWarnings default TRUE. Show warnings? Will be passed on to dir.create
* recursive default TRUE. Will be passed on to dir.create
* mode Default permissions on unix-alike systems. Will be passed on to dir.create

#### Details

Default response to dir = "../output/" fixes the directory name like this, "../output/20151118-1/"
because usedate is assumed TRUE. If usedate = FALSE, then output names will be like "../output-
1/", "../output-2/", and so forth.

#### Value

a character string with the directory name
