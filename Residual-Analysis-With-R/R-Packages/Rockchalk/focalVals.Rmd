focalVals Create a focal value vector.

#### Description

This selects some values of a variable and creates a new "focal vector" from them. Can use one
"divider" algorithm, to be selected by name.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
focalVals(x, divider = "quantile", n = 3)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* x The input variable may be numeric or a factor.
* divider Either a quoted string name of an algorithm or a function. Default = "quantile"= for numeric variables, "table" for factors. Other valid values: "seq" for an evenly spaced sequence from minimum to maximum, "std.dev." for a sequence that has the mean at the center and values on either side that are proportional to the standard deviation.
* n Desired number of focal values.

#### Details
This is a "wrapper" (or convenience) function that re-directs work to other functions. The functions
that do the work to select the focal values for types ("table", "quantile", "std.dev.", "seq") are
(``cutByTable()``, ``cutByQuantile()``, ``cutBySD()``, and ``plotSeq()``)
The built-in R function ``pretty()`` works as of rockchalk 1.7.2. Any function that accepts an argument
n will work, as long as it creates a vector of values.

#### Value
A named vector of focal values selected from a variable. The values of the names should be informative
and useful for plotting or other diagnostic work.
