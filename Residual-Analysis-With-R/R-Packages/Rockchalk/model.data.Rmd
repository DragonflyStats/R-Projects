Create a "raw" (UNTRANSFORMED) data frame equivalent to the input data that would be required to fit the given model.

#### Description

This is a generic method. Unlike model.frame and model.matrix, this does not return transformed variables. It deals with regression formulae that have functions like poly(x, d) in them. It differentiates x from d in those expressions. And it also manages log(x + 10). The default method works for standarad R regression models like lm and glm.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
model.data(model, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* model A fitted regression model in which the data argument is specified. This function will fail if the model was not fit with the data option.
* ... Arguments passed to implementing methods.

#### Value
A data frame
