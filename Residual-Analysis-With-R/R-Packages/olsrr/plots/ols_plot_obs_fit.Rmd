 Observed vs fitted values plot

#### Description 
 
Plot of observed vs fitted values to assess the fit of the model.

####Usage 
<pre><code>

ols_plot_obs_fit(model)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments 
 
model An object of class lm.

#### Details 
 
Ideally, all your points should be close to a regressed diagonal line. Draw such a diagonal line
within your graph and check out where the points lie. If your model had a high R Square, all the
points would be close to this diagonal line. The lower the R Square, the weaker the Goodness of fit
of your model, the more foggy or dispersed your points are from this diagonal line.
Deprecated Function
ols_ovsp_plot() has been deprecated. Instead use ols_plot_obs_fit().
ols_plot_reg_line 25

####Examples 
```{r} 

model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
ols_plot_obs_fit(model)

```
