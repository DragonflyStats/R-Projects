### {gvlma}

#### Global Validation of Linear Model Assumptions

* The {gvlma} package is a comprehensive, automatic testing suite for many of the assumptions of general linear models. 

* Perform a single global test to assess the linear model assumptions, as well as perform specific
directional tests designed to detect skewness, kurtosis, a nonlinear link function, and heteroscedasticity

* It does both statistical tests and diagnostic plots using an extremely simple implementation for powerful results.

### {gvlma}

The package is an implementation of a paper by Pena & Slate called ***Global Validation of Linear Model Assumptions*** and allows you to quickly check for:

* ***Linearity*** - the Global Stat tests for the null hypothesis that our model is a linear combination of its predictors.

* ***Homoscedasticity*** - the respective stat tests for the null that the residial variance is relatively constant over the range of values.

* ***Normality*** - skewness and kurtosis tests help you understand if the residuals fits a normal distribution. 

* If the null is rejected you probably need to transform your data in some way (like a log transform). 
This can also be assessed by looking at the normal probability plot it generates.

```{r echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
model <- Fit_4
```

```{r message=FALSE}
  library("gvlma")

  # model <- lm(y ~ x, data)
  
  
  summary(gvlma(model))
```

### {gvlma}

* Global Stat checks whether the relationship between the dependent and independent relationship roughly linear.

* Skewness and kurtosis assumptions show that the distribution of the residuals are normal.

* Link function checks to see if the dependent variable is continuous or categorical. 

---

### {gvlma}

* The diagnostic plots also let you understand the relation between your data and these assumptions visually. 
* Other useful capabilities are the link function test which is used for understanding whether the underlying data is categorical or continuous.
