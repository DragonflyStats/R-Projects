that we ran a study with two conditions: a control condition that will serve as the baseline and an experimental condition that we'll call condition C. 
Now the Level 2 model of the Level 1 intercept coefficient /3oi will be: 
= 7oo 7oc â€¢ C 
(2.3) 
where -yoo is the baseline value of 130i, 70c is the fixed effect (also sometimes called structural effect) of condition C on the intercept, and (oi is the 
random (also called residual or stochastic) deviation from that baseline for individual i. This Level 2 model does two things. 
First, it allows condition C to have this isintercept that is different from the baseline intercept. 
Conceptually, is is roughly like a t-test comparing condition C to the baseline and typ-fically, these are the effects of primary interest. 
Second, it defines a structure tohr the random variation in the intercept: it says that all observations within e_ set indexed by i should have the same intercept, winch Call differ for other alues ofi. In other words, the random effect structure captures the nested
