plotting model fit 


It is always a good idea to plot the model fit with the observed data.

Since the model fit lines don't have a points shape, we can also map Group to the linetype aesthetic so making the lines different between groups.

----------------------------------------

The model fit in Figure 2.3 appears to be quite good and it specifically seems to capture the difference in rate of recovery between the placebo and amantadine groups. 
For both groups, the first and last data points are slightly above the line while the middle three points are slightly below it. 
This suggests that there might be a small amount of curvature in the recovery pattern - faster initial recovery that slows down over the course of the 4 weeks of treatment. 
The next chapter will discuss how to model more complex data curves.

2.4 Another example: Visual search response times The primary focus of growth •curve analysis -- and longitudinal data analysis :echniques in general — is to capture change 
over time, so 
most of the examples irirthis hook will have some version of time as the main predictor. However, many of the same issues hold for other sorts of repeated 
measures scenarioz, \,.itli a continuous predictor. For example, response times in a conjunction ti,isual search task tend to be a linear function of the 
number of objet'ts ill • ,\ie., displaY (called "set size"). 

In other words, I 0-1. among g w_ien looking for a green letter reen "X's" and brown "N's," response
