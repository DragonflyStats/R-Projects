gradual change over time can be difficult to detect: because it is gradual. the overall effect will be weak and because each time bin (trial block) has only a small amount of data, individual time bin comparisons are underpowered. In other words, there is a trade-off between statistical power. which requires more data and therefore larger time windows, and temporal resolution. which requires smaller time windows but undermines statistical power. 

1.3.2 Possibility of experimenter bias Consider the data in Figure 1.2, which are based on a spoken word comprehen-sion experiment using eye-tracking (Magnuson, Dixon, Tanenhaus, 2007). 

The curves show the probability of fixating the named (-target-) pic-ture over time, starting at word onset. 
How could we verify that the crossover effect is statistically significant? We could divide the time range into an early time window (before the crossover point) and a later time window (after the crossover point) and test whether the condition effect is different in the two time windows. However, if that crossover was not predicted, or even if just the specific timing of the crossover point had not been predicted, then using the observed data themselves to define the analysis would constitute a case of Simmons.mble-diPPing," which increases the rate of false positives (e.g., Kriegeskorte, S Bell rowan. Az Baker, 2009).
