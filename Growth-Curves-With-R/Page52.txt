learned to match a made-up spoken "word" like pibu with a novel geomet7.: shape. All of these "words" were completely novel and arbitrarily paired with shapes and 
counterbalanced across participants. 
There were two shape choices on each trial, so it is not very interesting that accuracy would start around 50%, making the y-intercept not very informative. 

On the other hand. the overall mean accuracy does (partially) reflect faster learning, so the orthog: oral intercept will be more informative. 
Second, orthogonal polynomials \v1-- make the linear and quadratic terms uncorrelated, so we will be able to In-dependently evaluate the •linear slope
