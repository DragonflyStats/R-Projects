When change over time is not linear 
41 
unlike a polynomial function (e.g., Equation 3.1), the LP function does not look like a multiple linear regression equation. Its non-linearity is not just a matter of having non-linear Time predictor(s), the variables also have non-linear properties. Let's take a closer look at what happens if we try to use this function to model multilevel data.

FIGURE 3.3 Consequences of lack of dynamic consistency in the logistic power peak func-tion. 
The circles are the average of the observed data. 
The solid black line is the model of those average data. 
The grey lines are the models of the indi-vidual participants. 
The dashed line is the curve produced by averaging the parameters from the models of the individual participants. 
The dashed line does not match the solid line, nor does it reflect the central tendency of the models of the individual participants. 
The data for this example come from an eye-tracking experiment (Mirmon 4z, Magnuson, 2009) in which the out come measure was the probability of looks (` fixation proportion") to a particular object at each point in time. The black
