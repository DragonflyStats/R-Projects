3.2.3 Alaking predictions: Fits and forecasts ■Iodels can make two fundamentally different kinds of "predictions": modF I fits within the 
boundaries of the observed data and model forecasts for 
what would happen outside of those boundaries. For forecast-type predictions it is critical that the model have a functional form that matches the form of the system that 
generated the .observed. data. 

If it does not, then its forecasts ;re likely to be wrong. This is precisely the logic of cognitive or computa-tional 
modeling (as opposed to statistical modeling): build a model that has the hypothesized properties of the system under investigation and conduct simulations of 
that model to see if it fits the observed data. Critically. mak-ina novel predictions   that is, forecasts for what should happen outside the boundaries of the data that were 
used to develop the model — is considered the best test of computational models (for a good discussion of computational modeling in cognitive science see McClelland, 2009). 

Computational models are meant to implement theories and theories need to be falsifiable, so making and testing falsifiable predictions is a critical aspect of computational mod-eling. 
When a computational model's prediction is found to be wrong, this provides critical evidence that the model was wrong, either in theory or in implementation, and is grounds for 
rejecting that model or at least preferring an alternative (for more discussion of computational model evaluation and rejection see Magnuson, Mirman, & Harris, 2012). 
Fit-type predictions are more accurately called quantitative descriptions of the observed data because their goal is to summarize the data patterns rather than to make 
novel (falsifiable) predictions. 

It is useful to have a description of the data that is not tied to a particular theory because the data are always -true," hut a theory 
can be wrong. For example, imagine that we made some very careful neuroanatomicai measurements buI, then described them entirely within the framework of 
phrenology (e.g., sizes of the ()rpm of friendship, the Organ of courage, etc.). 

The measurements could luive remained informative doin, be Possible to constrain 
the logistic function to be dynk-unically consistent, but lIt rfla so is quite difficult and requires fairly complex programming, so it will not be covered 'this book.
