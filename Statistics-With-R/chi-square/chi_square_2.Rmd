\begin{slide}{Chi Square test}

Chi Square test are used when one wants to check whether a sample comes from some type of population,
or when one wants to check that two samples are from the same population.

\begin{itemize}
\item Goodness of fit tests.
\item Testing for association in contingency tables.
\end{itemize}

The $R$ command for chi squared tests is chisq.test().
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Chi-Square test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goodness of fit test is used to test whether a sample comes from a specified distribution.
\item The sample is univariate.
\item $R$ assumes a null hypothesis that each outcome is equally likely ( uniformly distributed).
\item chisq.test(x)
\item Can specify the distribution of expected values under the null hypothesis for other cases using the `p' parameter.
\item chisq.test(x,p)
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{itemize}
\item Example: In an experiment of 100 trials, the number of times that each of the four possible outcomes
occured was recorded.\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
  Event & A & B & C & D \\\hline
  Outcomes & 59 & 20 & 11 & 10 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\item It was presupposed that each outcome was equally likely \\(i.e. The null hypothesis is $H_{0} : P_{A} = P_{B} = P_{C} = P_{D}$.)\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
  Event & A & B & C & D \\\hline
  Expected & 25 & 25 & 25 & 25 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\item Under the null hypothesis, any deviations from the expected values are attributable to random error.

\end{itemize}

{Chi Square tests}


\begin{verbatim}
> chisq.test(c(59,20,11,10))

Chi-squared test for given probabilities

data:  c(59, 20, 11, 10)
X-squared = 64.08, df = 3,
p-value = 7.891e-14
\end{verbatim}

The p-value indicates that we should reject the hypothesis that there is an equal likely outcomes.


{Chi Square test}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you do not want equal proportions, you need to give a set of
proportions for each cell (using the `p' parameter).
\item Genetic theory predicts that certain fruit flies
will fall into four categories in proportions 9:3:3:1.
\item Data showed counts of 59, 20, 11 and 10.
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
> chisq.test(c(59,20,11,10),
 p=c(9/16,3/16,3/16,1/16))

Chi-squared test for given probabilities

data:  c(59, 20, 11, 10)
X-squared = 5.6711, df = 3, p-value = 0.1288
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}
\begin{slide}{Chi Square test}
\begin{itemize}
\item We would not reject the theoretical hypothesis with these data.
\item Deviations from expected values are attributed to random error.
\end{itemize}
